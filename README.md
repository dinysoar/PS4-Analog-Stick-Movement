# PS4 Controller Analog Stick Visualizer

This program uses Pygame and a PS4 controller to create a graphical interface that displays movement and color changes based on your PS4 controller's analog stick and trigger inputs.

## Requirements
To run this program, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- Pygame (can be installed using pip install pygame)
- A PS4 controller connected to your computer

## Usage
1. Connect your PS4 controller to your computer using a USB cable or via Bluetooth.
2. Run the ps4_game_movement_visualizer.py script using Python.
3. The program should display a Pygame window with a rectangle. Use the left analog stick on your PS4 controller to move the rectangle left, right, up or down. Use the left and right triggers to change the color of the rectangle.
Customization

You can customize this program by modifying the values in the ps4_game_movement_visualizer.py script. For example:

- Change the size or color of the rectangle by modifying the player and color variables.
- Modify the input handling logic to add more functionality, such as controlling a different game or application.


## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues while running this program, please ensure that your PS4 controller is properly connected and recognized by your computer. You can also try running the program with administrator privileges or using a different USB cable or Bluetooth connection.

## Acknowledgments
This program was inspired by various Pygame and PS4 controller tutorials and resources online. Special thanks to the Pygame community and the developers of the Pygame controller module for making this project possible.
